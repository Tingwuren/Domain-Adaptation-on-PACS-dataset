## üóÇ Folder organization
This repo is organized as follows: 
- `/code` contains the different modules used to train and evaluate different models.
- `/PDFs` contains details about experiments and discuss the results.
- `/images` contains some example images.

## Problem description
In many ML task we often assumes that the training data are representative of the underlying distribution. However, if the inputs at test time differ
significantly from the training data, the model might not perform very well. 

> Domain adaptation is the ability to apply an algorithm trained in one or more "source domains" to a different (but related) "target domain". Domain adaptation is a subcategory of transfer learning. This scenario arises when we aim at learning from a source data distribution a well performing model on a different target data distribution. (Wikipedia)

In order to tackle the issue, a modified version of the AlexNet [1] is used allowing not only to classify input images in the source domain but also to transfer this capability to the target domain. 

### Dataset
For this anaysis the PACS dataset [2] is used. It contains overall 9991 images, splittd unevenly among:
- 7 classes (Dog, Elephant, Giraffe, Guitar, Horse, House, Person) and 
- 4 domains: `Art painting`, `Cartoon`, `Photo` and `Sketch`.
